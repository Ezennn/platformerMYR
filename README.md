### Story Progression ###
- You are an incel. You clicked on the link "Single Horses Around my area". The Horse God did not like it. He sent a thunder and blow you into smithereens. You wake up to see yourself as a knight stuck at a temple. Somehow you horses don't exist in this world and that it is your duty to invent them. The first move of your story would obvs be to travel to the closest town to acquire about what the world is like.
- Little do u know that because horses weren't invented yet, the world is falling apart. The ruined temples and existence of slimes proves this. Once you have invented horses, the Horse Gods promise to forgive you and send you back with the working link.

last line become 
velocity.y = clamp(velocity.y, -MAX_FALL_SPEED_WHILE_ON_WALL, JUMP_VELOCITY)
jump velocity is negative

maybe this will become a feature of the game; uncontrollable walls
