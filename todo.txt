fix why pause menu in every scene
serializable json to save application stuff between runs incl high coin score 
score for killing slimes

done: 
fixed gamemanager causing some black frames between reloading after deaths. Gray frames remaining but grey frames due to different problem with reload_current_scene not being instantaneuous
added a coin to lvl 1
added save points

todo:
score
made slimes turn less frequently
SAVE ACCOUNTS 
slowdown effect 
save keybinds and save accounts 
check conflict when change keybind 

pass thru slimes when dash
platform swingy bridge make passable platform 
sword and shield sprite have to edit
signal cleaning 
many coins to win 
level 2 connections
walljump rebound back 
Main scene set as main menu 
bug when pause during death scene 
bug when fire killed me but at same time i killed slime 
fireballs sometimes slow down time but not kill

// Autojump small ledges
//background make infinite extending in levels

level 1: default + tutorial

Level 2: walls become elevators
func handle_gravity_and_animation(delta: float) -> void:
	if not is_on_floor() :
		velocity += get_gravity() * delta
		if animated_sprite.animation != "dash":
			play_animation_with_priority("jump")
	if (is_on_wall_left or is_on_wall_right) and jump_x_velocity_override == null:
		# upper clamped using jump velocity to deal with wall jumps
		velocity.y = clamp(velocity.y, -MAX_FALL_SPEED_WHILE_ON_WALL, MAX_FALL_SPEED_WHILE_ON_WALL)

On win screen can still move 
Level 3: the whole world moving: Level 2 node just put a script going to the right
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	position.x -= direction * SPEED * delta
Level 4: start with a bunch of slimes immediately running towards the player flying, need to jump up immediately and squish the slimes. No idea for gimmick
Extremely bouncy slimes
Level 5: user dash just stops all movement, consecutive dash and hold down dash enabled
Dying to fireball slows down the game, dying to green slime speeds it up 

Ladders slide

last line become 
velocity.y = clamp(velocity.y, -MAX_FALL_SPEED_WHILE_ON_WALL, JUMP_VELOCITY)
jump velocity is negative

maybe this will become a feature of the game; uncontrollable walls
